## Summary of the Project

We will set up a ghast that is floating in the sky, and the character will be located in a ditch. The ghast can shoot fireballs, fire balls will explode when it lands and create a small igniting zone. The character's mission is to kill this ghast by hitting the fireball back, and it exactly lands on the ghast. Thus, the character needs to learn how to hit the fireball in a perfect angle and timing. In the process, he needs to deceide where hit the fireball or dodge it based on the information he got in each frames.

## AI/ML Algorithms

We decide to use RL on learning the hitting angle, hitting timing, and character movement. At the beignning, the character does not know how hit the fireball and whether he can reach the fireball. He will hit and move randomly. Each chance of hitting the fireball is a reward for the character in movement, and each chance of hitting back the fireball closer to the ghast is a reward in hitting. 

## Evaluation Plan

Our baseline for this project is to make the character stay alive and kill the ghast successfully. Once we achieved the baseline, we will consider to increase the number of grasps to increase the diffculty of this game and decrease the time of killing the ghast. 

When we present our project, we will show ??
